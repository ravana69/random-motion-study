# Random motion study

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Dillo/pen/LYeOKWL](https://codepen.io/Dillo/pen/LYeOKWL).

At the beginning, really a random motion study. I wanted the path to be reasonably smooth, to control the tortuosity and have a constant step at every iteration.  
When it began to work, I found it was funny to play with colors and other effects.  
Just vanilla javascript, as usual.
